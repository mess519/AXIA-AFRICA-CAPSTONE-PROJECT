# AXIA-AFRICA-CAPSTONE-PROJECT
PREDICTING RESTAURANT , RECOMMENDATION AND ANALYSIS USING MACHINE LEARNING MODELS


This repository contains my final project for Axia Africa, completed in April 2025. The project involved working with a large restaurant dataset, where my main goal was to build a model to predict restaurant ratings and extract meaningful insights from the data. My regression model achieved an accuracy of 94%, with further details provided below.

Objective:
Develop a machine learning model to predict a restaurant's aggregate rating based on its other features.

Steps:

Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and split the dataset into training and testing sets.

Model Selection & Training: Choose a regression algorithm (e.g., linear regression, decision tree regression) and train it on the training data.

Model Evaluation: Assess the modelâ€™s performance on the testing data using regression metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.

Results Interpretation: Analyze the model to identify and understand the most influential features affecting restaurant ratings.
