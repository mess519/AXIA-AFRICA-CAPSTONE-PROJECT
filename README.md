# AXIA-AFRICA-CAPSTONE-PROJECT
PREDICTING RESTAURANT , RECOMMENDATION AND ANALYSIS USING MACHINE LEARNING MODELS


This repository contains my final project for Axia Africa, completed in April 2025. The project involved working with a large restaurant dataset, where my main goal was to build a model to predict restaurant ratings and extract meaningful insights from the data. My regression model achieved an accuracy of 94%, with further details provided below.

TASK 1

Objective:
Develop a machine learning model to predict a restaurant's aggregate rating based on its other features.

Steps:

Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values, encode categorical variables, and split the dataset into training and testing sets.

Model Selection & Training: Choose a regression algorithm (e.g., linear regression, decision tree regression) and train it on the training data.

Model Evaluation: Assess the model’s performance on the testing data using regression metrics such as Mean Squared Error (MSE) and R-squared.

Results Interpretation: Analyze the model to identify and understand the most influential features affecting restaurant ratings.

TASK 2

Objective:
Develop a restaurant recommendation system tailored to user preferences.

Steps:

Data Preprocessing: Handle missing values and encode categorical variables.

Define Recommendation Criteria: Identify factors for recommendations, such as cuisine type and price range.

Implement Recommendation Model: Use a content-based filtering approach to suggest restaurants that match users’ preferences.

Testing & Evaluation: Test the system with sample user preferences and assess the quality of the recommendations.
