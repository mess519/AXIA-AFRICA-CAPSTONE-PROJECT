# AXIA-AFRICA-CAPSTONE-PROJECT
PREDICTING RESTAURANT , RECOMMENDATION AND ANALYSIS USING MACHINE LEARNING MODELS

The project involved working with a large restaurant dataset, where my main goal was to build a model to predict restaurant ratings and extract meaningful insights from the data. My regression model achieved an accuracy of 94%, with further details provided below.
